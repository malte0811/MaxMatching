   @class Graph

   @brief A @c Graph stores an array of @c Node s, but no array of edges. The list of edges is implicitly given
   by the fact that the nodes know their neighbors.

   This class models undirected graphs only (in the sense that the method @c add_edge(node1, node2) adds both @c node1
   as a neighbor of @c node2 and @c node2 as a neighbor of @c node1). It also forbids loops, but parallel edges are
   legal.

   @warning Nodes are numbered starting at 0, as is usually done in programming,
    instead starting at 1, as is done in the DIMACS format that your program should take as input!
    Be careful.
